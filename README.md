# Database made with JSON and localStorage

This is a college project made with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, which I did a University website with fake back-end utilizing localStorage and JSON for creating the database.

Functions in the website: 
  - Sign Up function, registering the name, surname, ID, University-ID, E-mail and password;
  - It makes the validations of the E-mail;
  - It makes the validation if the inputs are emtpy;

  - Login index page, validating the University-ID and the password;
  - After validation, low-key college website appearing user informations (complete name, ID, University-ID and E-mail);

  - Forgot my password page, validating the University-ID and the e-mail, then proceeds to ask a new password and uptading it;
  - Forgot my University-ID page, validating the ID. If the ID is in the "database", It shows the University-ID. If isn't, then says that this ID doesn't exists.

  - It allows multiple Sign Ups, creating one profile to each registration, that's why I call it a "fake back-end".
 
 The focus wasn't in the looking itself, so It looks kinda poor in that way. My goal was to make a functional fake back-end utilizing just raw JavaScript, with localStorage and JSON imports.
